## One day workshop on network science, with a focus on creating node-level features in multiplex networks using matrix multiplication

This webpage contains all the materials for a one-day workshop on network science. The materials on this website are [GNU General Public License v3.0](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html) licensed.

## Course objectives

How can networks help us understand and predict social systems? This course introduces concepts and tools in network science. The objective of the course is that participants acquire hands-on knowledge on how to analyze different types of networks. Participants will be able to understand when a network approach is useful, understand different types of networks, understand the differences and similarities between a Complex Networks and a Social Network Analysis approach, describe network characteristics, creating node-level features in multiplex networks.

The course has a hands-on focus, with lectures accompanied by programming practicals (in Python) to apply the knowledge on real networks.
